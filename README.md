## üöÄ Projects Included

This portfolio serves as a hub for several of my standalone projects. You can run them directly from the live demo or by opening the corresponding HTML files.

1.  **Interactive To-Do List (`todo.html`)**: A sleek and responsive to-do list app built with vanilla JavaScript. It features DOM manipulation for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete, with all data saved to the browser's local storage.
2.  **Classic Pong with AI Banter (`pong.html`)**: A recreation of the classic arcade game using HTML5 Canvas. It includes a simple AI opponent and a unique feature where the AI generates real-time commentary and trash talk using the Gemini API.
3.  **CS Fundamentals Quiz (`quiz.html`)**: A fun, multiple-choice quiz app to test basic computer science knowledge. It showcases application state management, dynamic content rendering, and user feedback mechanisms.
